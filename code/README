libdisorder: entropy measurement

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a readme file. See

for more information.

libdisorder is a small, simple C library for use by programmers in
other programs. There is a small test program included that opens
/dev/urandom and calls libdisorder in the `test/' directory. There is
also a command-line tool, `ropy' in the `tool/' directory for reporting
on the entropy of normal files.

You will probably want to pipe the output of libdisorder to some other
math analysis or graphing environment (e.g., gnuplot).

The library's primary function reports entropy in bits: essentially,
this is the number of bits necessary to encode the actual level of
information contained in the data passed to the library: it is the
theoretical maximum amount of compression possible.
