libdisorder: entropy measurement
$Id$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a readme file. See 

     http://libdisorder.freshdefense.net/

for more information.

libdisorder is a small, simple C library for use by programmars in
other programs. There is a small test program included that opens
/dev/urandom and calls libdisorder in the `test/' directory. There is
also a command-line tool, `ropy' in the `tools/' directory for reporting
on the total entropy of normal files. `tropy' in `tools/' will report
entropy per BLOCKSIZE for the file.

You will probably want to pipe the output of libdisorder to some other
math analysis or graphing environment (e.g., gnuplot). For example:
   ./test/testexec |dd bs=62 count=1000|gnuplot -p -e 'plot "-" using 2:4;'
   ./tools/tropy /bin/ls | gnuplot -p -e 'plot "-" using 2:4;'

The library's primary function reports entropy in bits: essentially,
this is the number of bits necessary to encode the actual level of
information contained in the data passed to the library: it is the
theoretical maximum amount of compression possible.
